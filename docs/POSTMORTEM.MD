# Project Post Mortem Discussion

Group Members: Yiming Cai, Richard Fu, Gurnoor Grewal, Peter Luong, Anuvrat Sharma

## What worked well in this project, and what didn't?

   - What worked well:
   		- Not having defined roles for the entire project as members worked on things together and  pretty much got our 
   		  planned features for each release completed on time 
   		- Having one 90 min meeting a week with good communication and work done during the meeting
   		- Having a group chat on Facebook to regulary give updates on what we were working on, updates, and any challenges
   		faced/ features changed

   	- What did not work well:
   		- Having many other commitments with other courses such as assignments and tests which interfered with work from 
   		  this course
   		- Not rescheduling two cancelled meetings because it delayed some of our planned features for Release 3

## What would you have done differently knowing what you know now?
   
    - Adapting better to unforseen circumstances such as the weather and sickness (bus factor)
    - Managing time better (Individual work vs group work)
    - Better implementation of the Incremental Development Model

## What was the biggest unexpected challenge?

   - Inexperience among group memebers was the biggest challenge. This includes some members of the group not being familiar with JavaScript. 
     Therefore, the inexperienced members were trying to learn a new programming language while also trying to complete required features.
   
## Was all the testing worth it?

   - We believe that the testing was worth it for this project. However, automated testing does not need to a big part 
     of the project. Unit testing and user testing are both helpful types of testing that should be done. Unit testing helped 
     us identify bugs in parts of our emulator and visualizer. In regards to user testing, we were pretending to 
     be the users by using our emulator to play games and run programs. This was very helpul for us to create smoother UI and fix
     any bugs. 

## What advice would you give to the next students who take 276 ?

   - You do not get to choose your groupmates so be polite, courteous, and professional while working with them
   - Be familiar with some JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
   - Be prepared to spend lots of time on this project so take other courses accordingly
