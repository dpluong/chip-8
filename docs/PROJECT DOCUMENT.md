Group Members: Yiming Cai, Richard Fu, Gurnoor Grewal, PETER Luong, Anuvrat Sharma

This project document describes the conditions and planning of the product produced by the CMPT 276 Surrey Spring 2019 Group 8 Team.

The product being produced is a CHIP8 emulator, visualizer, a CHIP8 helper tool, and two CHIP8 games.

The purpose of this project is to help understand how to create applications in a team setting and will be used to show competence in the topics taught by CMPT 276.

The final release of the product is expected on April 8, 2019, with intermediate releases required as described in "Software Methodology".

## In-person Meeting Times
The members of the team shall meet at least weekly for a period of at most 90 minutes every Monday after class. Meetings will by held in **room 3262** if possible.

If the room is already booked or otherwise not available, or if the scheduled meeting time for the week has changed, an alternative meeting time and/or spot shall by any group member via a post/message on all communication channels at least 24 hours before the scheduled meeting time.

If any member cannot make the meeting, they should let the team members know as soon as possible. Multiple unexcused absences will be considered as abandoning the project and will be handled accordingly.


## Communication Methods
The members of the team are members of a Facebook Messenger group chat for the purpose of discussing any issues or questions that may arise.

## Code Repository
All code and files relating to the project are hosted on a Git repository stored at Bitbucket. All team members will have access to it.

## Software Languages/Tools
The project will be coded using JavaScript, with an HTML/CSS frontend.
To facilitate testing and easier use of external libraries, Node.JS and the NPM package manager will also be used.
There is no required editor, and members are free to use any editor of their choice.

## Software Methodology
The project will be managed using an incremental development process, with 4 releases.
Each release date is as follows:
* Feb 6, 2019
* Feb 27, 2019
* Mar 13, 2019
* Apr 8, 2019
A general guide towards the expected state of the product for each release is located under "Release Overview".
The detailed plan and workflow for the next release shall be posted below the "Release Overview‚Äù and will be updated with the plan for the next release as the previous release is completed.
The roles each member has will be set only for one release at a time and may change after each release.

## Testing Frameworks
Mocha will be used as the testing framework for this project.
In addition, ESLint shall be used to ensure the code style is consistent. The code style shall be kept in sync with the code style used by Airbnb.

## QA Methods
All features need to have a test attached to it on Mocha.
In addition, if any bugs are found, a test needs to be created that tests that the bug is fixed.
All code shall be reviewed and approved by at least 50% of the group before it can be merged into the main master branch.
